This layout a "mission-style" layout in which humans must
clean the station15 after it has been invaded by aliens.
It is built for the following rules:

* `/lock a`: prevents players to join alien team;
* `/bot fill a 6; bot fill h 3`: recommended number of
	players;
* 2 alien bots per human player (there is currently no way
	to have the game automatically manage this);
* `g_disabledEquipements ckit` to prevent human team to
	build, as this makes the map way too easy to win;
